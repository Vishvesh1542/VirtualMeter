# VirtualMeter
It is a tiny script which runs and changes your rainmeter theme and wallpaper based on the different Windows Virutal desktops you are in

## Usage
Just put the script in the startup folder usually found in "C:\Users\[USER NAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"

##  Personalization
You can personalise the app by editing the config.ini file. There might be a GUI enabled method in the future.
